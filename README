            Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK)
             version 3.1 release October 1, 2007

The Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK) was developed and
has been used in the research group of Prof. Satoshi Imai
(currently he is with Chiba Institute of Technology) and
Prof. Takao Kobayashi (currently he is with Interdisciplinary
Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of
Technology) at P&I laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology.
This time some tools are chosen and arranged for distribution by
Prof. Keiichi Tokuda (currently he is with Department
of Computer Science, Nagoya Institute of Technology) as an
organizer in cooperation with Takashi Masuko (currently he is with
the Corporate Research & Development Center, Toshiba Corporation), 
Dr. Kazuhito Koishida (currently he is with Microsoft Research), 
and some graduate students.

The original source codes have been written by many people who
took part in research of the research group.  The most original
source codes of this distribution were written by Takao
Kobayashi (graph, data processing, FFT, sampling rate
conversion, etc.), Keiichi Tokuda (speech analysis, speech
synthesis, etc.), and Kazuhito Koishida (LSP, vector
quantization, etc.).

This version is accompanied by a Reference Manual (a total of
180 pages written in Japanese).  A User's Manual "Examples for
using SPTK" is also attached.  We are planing to translate the
Reference Manual into English.

                            Copying
****************************************************************

The Speech Signal Processing Toolkit (SPTK) version 3.0 is
released under a free license, without the commercial
restrictions we imposed on early versions (1.0 and 2.0).  The
toolkit has been placed under an X11 type license which as free
licenses go is pretty free.  We have deliberately chosen a
license that should be compatible with our commercial partners
and our free software users.  Note that there is no difference
between version 2.0 and 3.0 except the license.

However, although the code is free, we still offer no warranties
and no maintenance.  We will continue to endeavor to fix bugs
and answer queries when can, but are not in a position to
guarantee it.  We will consider maintenance contracts and
consultancy if desired, please contacts us for details.

If you are using SPTK in commercial environment, even though no
license is required, we would be grateful if you let us know as
it helps justify ourselves to our various sponsors.

The current copyright on the toolkit is

****************************************************************
                          Environment
****************************************************************

We expect that all programs can be compiled and can work on most
UNIX workstations.  Although we have confirmed that all programs
can be compiled in the following environments:

  SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, FreeBSD, OSF1, Linux

we have not confirmed that all programs can work properly in all
these environments.

Note that some commands need C-shell (/bin/csh) since they are
implemented by C-shell scripts.

****************************************************************
                          Installation
****************************************************************

0) Enter 'src' directory.

1) Type

        % ./configure --help
   
   and read the help messages.

2) To build and install all tools, type:

        % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/SPTK
        % make
        % make install

The X-window library is not required for compilation of all tools
except a command 'xgr' since only 'xgr' uses the X-window library.

****************************************************************
                             Notice
****************************************************************

As the version advances, specifications for the Speech Signal
Processing Toolkit will be changed without notifications.

The distributed tools are a sub-set of the whole toolkit.
Therefore, some commands which appear at EXAMPLE and SEE ALSO in
the Reference Manual may not be included in this version.

****************************************************************
                           Bug report
****************************************************************

Bug reports, comments, questions for the Speech Signal
Processing Toolkit are very welcome.  Please send them to

   dsp-cmnd@sp.nitech.ac.jp

by email. We will reply to any questions as much as possible but
we cannot assure that we will reply to all messages.

Please see

for more information about the Speech Signal Processing Toolkit,
(e.g., Examples for using Speech Signal Processing Toolkit).

****************************************************************
                             Notes
****************************************************************

Generic properties of each command are summarized as follows:

 i) Data has float-type format, i.e., single-precision floating
    point format.  This can be changed to double-type format by
    specifying a compile option.  

 ii) Data files do not have headers or any structures, i.e.,
     they are flat row files.

iii) Basically they manipulate data through standard input and
     standard output.

 iv) To display (error) messages they use standard error output
     rather than standard output.

  v) They do not request interactive key inputs.

 vi) Options are specified on the command line.

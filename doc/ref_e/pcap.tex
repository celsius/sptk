\begin{synopsis}
 \item[pcap] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$] {\em pcafile} [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
 {\em pcap} calculates principal component scores
 from {\em infile} (or standard input) ,
 sending the result to standard output.

 The input data set must be composed of $L$-dimension,
 mean and eigen vectors:
\[
 \Vec{x}(0), \Vec{x}(1), \Vec{x}(2), \Vec{x}(3), \cdots \;\;\;
 where\;\;\Vec{x}(i) = (x_{i}(1), x_{i}(2), \cdots, x_{i}(L))
\]

Input and output data are in float format. 
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
 \argm{l}{L}{dimentionality of vector}{3}
 \argm{n}{N}{number principal components for output}{2}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
 In the example below,
 the eigen vectors and the eigen values are
 calculated from three-dimentional training vectors
 from {\em pca.dat}.
 The mean vectors and eigen vectors are sent to
 {\em pca.dat}, and the eigen values are sent to {\em eigen.dat}.
\begin{quote}
  \verb!pcap pca.dat -l 3 -n 2 < test.dat > score.dat!
\end{quote} 
\end{qsection}
In the {\em pca.dat}, the mean vector must be in the front of
eigen vectors.

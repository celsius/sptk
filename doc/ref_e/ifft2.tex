\item[ifft2] [ --l $L$ ] [ +r ] [ --t ] [ --c ] [ --q ] 
	     [ --\{ R $|$ I \} ] [ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em ifft} calculates the 2-dimensional Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
(IDFT) of complex-valued data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the results to standard output.
The input and output data is in float format, arranged as follows.
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\includegraphics{fig/ifft2.eps}
\end{center}
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{FFT size power of 2}{256}
	\argp{{\bf r}}{regard input as real values rather than complex values}{FALSE}
	\argm{t}{}{Output results in transposed form (see also \hyperlink{fft2}{fft2}).}{FALSE}
	\argm{c}{}{When results are transposed, 1 boundary data is copied from the
	opposite side, and then output $(L+1)\times (L+1)$ data (see also \hyperlink{fft2}{fft2}).}{FALSE}
	\argm{R}{}{output only real part}{FALSE}
	\argm{I}{}{output only imaginary part}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
This example reads a sequence of 2-dimensional complex numbers in float format
from {\em data.f} file, evaluates its 2-dimensional IDFT and outputs it to {\em
data.dft} file:
\begin{quote}
  \verb!ifft2 -A < data.f > data.ifft2!
\end{quote}
\end{qsection}

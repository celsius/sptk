\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em uscd} converts the sample rate from one of 8, 10, 12, or 16 kHz 
to one of 11.025, 22.04, or 44.1 kHz.
If {\em infile} and {\em outfile} arguments are not given, 
standard input and standard output are used.
If the last argument names a directory, 
each of the preceding argument files is re-sampled. 
The results are stored in multiple files in that directory, 
with base names the same as the input file base names, 
but with suffixes reflecting the new sample rate.

		$S2$ can be abbreviated as 11, 22, or 44. \\
		If the last command line argument is a directory name, 
		the suffix for the output files is

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, speech data sampled at 16 kHz in short format
is read from {\em data.16}, up sampling to 22.05 kHz is undertaken,
and the results are written to {data.22}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!uscd +s -s 16 22.05 < data.16 > data.22!

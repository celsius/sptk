\item [uscd] [ --s $S$ $S$] [ +{\em type} ] [ {\em infile} ] [ {\em outfile} ]
\item [uscd] [ --s $S$ $S$] [ +{\em type} ] {\em infile1} $\dots$ [ {\em infileN}] {\em outdir} 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em uscd} converts the sample rate from one of 8, 10, 12, or 16 kHz 
to one of 11.025, 22.04, or 44.1 kHz.
If {\em infile} and {\em outfile} arguments are not given, 
standard input and standard output are used.
If the last argument names a directory, 
each of the preceding argument files is re-sampled. 
The results are stored in multiple files in that directory, 
with base names the same as the input file base names, 
but with suffixes reflecting the new sample rate.
\end{qsection}

%			S2 & $11.025|22.05|44.1$ & sampling rate of output data
%		\end{tabular}
%                where the assignment the following sampling rates 11.025, 
%                22.05, 44.1kHz can be done by 11, 22, 44, respectively.}

	\argm{S}{S2}{output sampling frequency  $11.025|22.05|44.1$\\
		$S2$ can be abbreviated as 11, 22, or 44. \\
		If the last command line argument is a directory name, 
		the suffix for the output files is 
		either ``.11'', ``.22'', or ``.44.''}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, speech data sampled at 16 kHz in short format
is read from {\em data.16}, up sampling to 22.05 kHz is undertaken,
and the results are written to {data.22}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!uscd +s -s 16 22.05 < data.16 > data.22!
\end{quote}

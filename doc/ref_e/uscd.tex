\name{uscd}{sampling rate conversion from
8|10|12|16kHz to 11.025|22.05|44.1kHz}{sampling rate transformation}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [uscd] [ --s $S$ $S$] [ +{\em type} ] [ {\em infile} ] [ {\em outfile} ]
\item [uscd] [ --s $S$ $S$] [ +{\em type} ] {\em infile1} $\cdots$ [ {\em infileN}] {\em outdir} 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
The command {\em uscd} converts from
8, 10, 12, 16kHz to 11.025, 22.05, 44.1kHz sampling rate.
If input and/or output files are not assigned,
then the standard input and/or output are used, respectively.
Also, several files can be assigned at same time.
In this case the output is automatically written in the assigned
{\em outdir} directory for every input file
changing the corresponding suffix.

Also, the assignment the following sampling rates 11.025, 22.05, 44.1kHz
can be done by 11, 22, 44, respectively.

			S2 & $11.025|22.05|44.1$ & sampling rate of output data
		\end{tabular}
                where the assignment the following sampling rates 11.025, 
                22.05, 44.1kHz can be done by 11, 22, 44, respectively.}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, speech data sampled at 16kHz in short format
is read from {\em data.16}, up sampling to 22.05kHz is undertaken,
and the results are written to {data.22}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!uscd -s 16 22.05 < data.16 > data.22!
\end{quote}

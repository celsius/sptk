{sampling rate transformation}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [us16] [ --s $S$ ] [ {\em infile} ] [ {\em outfile} ]
\item [us16] [ --s $S$ ] {\em infile1} $\dots$ [ {\em infileN}] {\em outdir} 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em us16} upsamples data from 10 kHz or 12 kHz to 16 kHz.
If the arguments {\em infile} and {\em outfile} are not given,
standard input and standard output are used.
If several input files are given,
the last argument is considered as a directory name
and multiple output files are created in that directory,
with names similar to the input file names
but with file extensions changed to ``.16''.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{s}{S}{input sampling frequency 10|12 kHz}{$10$}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, speech data sampled at 10 kHz
is read from {\em data.10}, upsampled to 16 kHz,
and the results are written to {data.16}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!us16 -s 10 < data.10 > data.16!
\end{quote}

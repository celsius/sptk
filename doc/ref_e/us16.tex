{sampling rate transformation}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [us16] [ --s $S$ ] [ +{\em type} ] [ {\em infile} ] [ {\em outfile} ]
\item [us16] [ --s $S$ ] [ +{\em type} ] {\em infile1} $\dots$ [ {\em infileN}] {\em outdir} 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em us16} upsamples data from 10kHz or 12kHz to 16kHz. 
If {\em infile} and {\em outfile} arguments are not given, 
standard input and standard output are used. 
If several input files are given, 
the last argument is taken to be a directory name 
and multiple output files are created in that directory, 
with names similar to the input file names 
but the suffixes are changed to ``.16''.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{s}{S}{input sampling frequency 10|12kHz}{$10$}
	\argp{t}{input data format\\
		\begin{tabular}{ll} \\[-1ex]
			s & short (2bytes) \\
			f & float (4bytes)
		\end{tabular}\\}{s}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, speech data sampled at 10kHz in short format
is read from {\em data.10}, up sampling to 16kHz is undertaken,
and the results are written to {data.16}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!us16 -s 10 < data.10 > data.16!
\end{quote}

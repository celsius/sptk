\item [mcep] [ --a $A$ ] [ --m $M$ ] [ --l $L$ ] [ --i $I$ ] [ --j $J$ ] 
	     [ --d $D$ ] [ --e $E$ ] [ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em mcep} uses mel-cepstral analysis 
to calculate mel-cepstral coefficients $c_{\alpha}(m)$ 
from $L$-length framed windowed data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the result to standard output.

Input and output data are in float format.

In the mel-cepstral analysis, the spectrum of the speech signal
is modeled by $M$-th order mel-cepstral coefficients $c_{\alpha}(m)$
as follows.
\begin{displaymath}
H(z) = \exp \sum_{m=0}^M c_{\alpha}(m) \tilde{z}^{-m} 
\end{displaymath}
For this command ``mcep'', it is applied a cost function
based on the unbiased estimation log spectrum method.
The variable $\tilde{z}^{-1}$ can be expressed as the following
first order all-pass function
\begin{displaymath}
\tilde{z}^{-1} = \frac{z^{-1}-\alpha}{1-\alpha z^{-1}}.
\end{displaymath}
The phase characteristic is given by the variable $\alpha$.
For a sampling rate 16 kHz, $\alpha$ is made equal to $0.42$.
For a sampling rate 10 kHz, $\alpha$ is made equal to $0.35$.
For a sampling rate 8 kHz, $\alpha$ is made equal to $0.31$.
By making these choices for $\alpha$,
the mel-scale becomes the good approximation to human
sensitivity to the loudness speech sound.

The Newton-Raphson method is used to minimize the cost function
when evaluating mel-cepstral coefficients.

	\argm{a}{A}{all-pass constant $\alpha$}{0.35}

\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
Speech data is read in float format from {\em data.f} and 
analyzed, and mel-cepstral coefficients are written to {\em data.mcep}:
\begin{quote}
 \verb!frame +f < data.f | window | mcep > data.mcep !
\end{quote}

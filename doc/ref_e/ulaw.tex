\begin{synopsis}
\item[ulaw] [ --v $V$ ] [ --u $U$ ] [ --c ] [ --d ] [ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em ulaw} converts data between 8-bit $\mu$-law and 16-bit linear formats.
The input data is {\rm infile} (or standard input),
and the output is sent to standard output.

If the input is $x(n)$, the output is $y(n)$,
the largest value of input data is $V$, the compression coefficients vector is $U$,
then the compression will be performed using made through the following equation.
\begin{displaymath}
y(n) = sgn(x(n)) V \frac{\log(1 + U \frac{|x(n)|}{V} )}{\log(1+U)}
\end{displaymath}
Likewise, the decompression can be performed by applying the following:
\begin{displaymath}
y(n) = sgn(x(n)) V \frac{(1+u)^{|x(n)|/V} - 1}{U}
\end{displaymath}
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{v}{V}{maximum value of input}{32768}
	\argm{u}{U}{compression ratio}{256}
	\argm{c}{}{coder mode}{TRUE}
	\argm{d}{}{decoder mode}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the following, 16-bit data read from {\em data.s}
is compressed to 8-bit ulaw format, and output to {\em data.ulaw}
\begin{quote}
  \verb!x2x +sf data.s | ulaw | sopr -d 256 | x2x +fc -r > data.ulaw!
\end{quote}

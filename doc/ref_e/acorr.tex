\name{acorr}{obtain autocorrelation sequence}{signal processing}

\begin{synopsis}
 \item[ acorr ] [ --m $M$ ] [ --l $L$ ] [ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em acorr} calculates the $m$-th order autocorrelation function sequence 
for each frame of float data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the result to standard output.
Namely, the input data is given by
\[ x(0),x(1),\dots,x(L-1), \]
 and the autocorrelation is evaluated as
\[ r(k)=\sum_{m=0}^{L-1-k}x(m)x(m+k), \qquad k=0,1,\dots,M, \]
 and the output is the following autocorrelation function sequence,
\[ r(0),r(1),\dots,r(M) \]
 Both input and output files are in float format.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{m}{M}{order of sequence}{25}
	\argm{l}{L}{frame length}{256}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, the input file {\em data.f} is in float format.
Here, the frame length and period are of 256 and 100, respectively.
Also, every frame is passed through a Blackman window and the
autocorrelation function sequence is sent to {\em data.acorr}.
\begin{center}
 \verb!frame -l 256 -p 100 < data.f | window | acorr -m 10 > data.acorr!
\end{center}

\end{synopsis} 

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em xgr} plots a graph from a sequence of FP5301 plotter commands, 
displaying the output on the screen in a new X window.

When the X window is created, 
the keyboard focus is initially assigned to that new window, 
which responds to a limited set of user interactions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Changing the window size truncates or expands the area 
	in which the graph is displayed, 
	but the graph remains the same size (i.e.
	it is not rescaled to fit the new window size).
\item If the graph is larger than the window, 
	the position within the window can be changed with 
	``vi'' cursor movement commands:
\begin{quote}
		h: left scroll\\
		j: down scroll\\
		k: up scroll\\
		l: right scroll
\end{quote}
\item To delete the window, type one of the following:
	``q'',``Ctrl-c'',``Ctrl-d''
\end{itemize}
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{s}{S}{shrink}{3.38667}
	\argm{l}{}{landscape}{FALSE}
	\argm{rv}{}{reverse mode}{FALSE}
	\argm{m}{}{monochrome display mode}{FALSE}
	\argm{bg}{BG}{background color}{white}
	\argm{hl}{HL}{highlight color}{blue}
	\argm{bd}{BD}{border color}{blue}
	\argm{ms}{MS}{mouse color}{red}
	\argm{g}{G}{geometry}{NULL}
	\argm{d}{D}{display}{NULL}
	\argm{t}{T}{window title}{xgr}
\end{options}
\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
The following example uses \hyperlink{fdrw}{fdrw} to draw a graph based on data read
from {\em data.f}, and sends the output to a X-Window environment:
\begin{quote}
 \verb!fdrw < data.f | xgr!
\end{quote}
\end{qsection}
\begin{qsection}{BUGS}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the display server does not contain backing store function,
then the hidden part of virtual screen is erased.

\item To reduce the waiting time to display graphs,
an image of virtual screen is copied to the memory.
If the size assigned by the --g option is too small
or if during the time the graph is being plotted another window
is put above the virtual screen, a part of the virtual screen
needs to be erased.
The --s option is suggested whenever the size of
the virtual screen should be reduced.
\end{itemize}

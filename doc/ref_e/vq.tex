\name{vq}{vector quantization}{vector quantization}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [vq] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$ ] [ --q ] {\em cbfile} [{\em infile}]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em vq} uses vector quantization to compress vectors 
from {\em infile} (or standard input)
according to the codebook {\em cbfile}, 
sending either codebook indices or quantized vectors to standard output.

For each length $L$ input vector
\begin{displaymath}
  x(0),x(1),\dots,x(L-1)
\end{displaymath}
{\em vq} finds the codebook vector $\bc_i$ 
that minimizes the Euclidian distance
\begin{displaymath}
d_i = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{m=0}^{L-1} (x(m)-c_i(m))^2. 
\end{displaymath}

Input data is in float format.
If the --q option is given, 
the output is the code vector $[c_i(0), c_i(1), \cdots, c_i(L-1)]$ 
in float format.
If the --q option is not given, 
the output is codebook index $i$ in int format.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{length of vector}{26}
	\argm{n}{N}{order of vector}{25}
	\argm{q}{}{output quantized vector}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In this example, a sequence of length 25 is read from {\em data.f}
in float format.
it is quantized using codebook {\em cbfile},
and the results are written to {\em data.vq}:
\begin{quote}
 \verb!vq -q cbfile < data.f > data.vq!
\end{quote}

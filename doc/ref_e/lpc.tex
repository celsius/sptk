\name{lpc}{LPC analysis using Levinson-Durbin method}{signal processing}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [lpc] [ --l $L$ ] [ --m $M$ ] [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em lpc} calculates linear prediction coeffiecients (LPC) 
from $L$-length framed windowed data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the result to standard output.

For each $L$-length input vector
\begin{displaymath}
  x(0),x(1),\ldots,x(L-1), 
\end{displaymath}
the autocorrelation function is calculated (see ``accor''),
then the gain $K$ and the linear prediction coefficients 
$a(k) (1 \leq k \leq M)$ 
\begin{displaymath}
  K, a(1), \ldots, a(M)
\end{displaymath}
are calculated using the Levinson-Durbin algorithm. 

Input and output data are in float format.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{frame length}{256}
	\argm{m}{M}{order of LPC}{25}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In this example, the 20 order linear prediction analysis is applied
to input read from {\em data.f} in float format,
and the linear prediction coefficients are written to
{\em data.lpc}:
\begin{quote}
 \verb!frame < data.f | window | lpc -m 20 > data.lpc!
\end{quote}

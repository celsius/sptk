	\item [delta] [ --m $M$ ] [ --l $L$ ] [ --t $T$ ]

		[ --r $N_R$ $W_1$ [$W_2$] ]  [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
	{\em delta} calculates dynamic features features from {\em infile} (or standard
	input), sending the result (static and dynamic features) to standard output. 
	The input and output formats are
    \begin{align}
	\mathrm{input}  & \dots, x_t(0), \dots, x_t(M), \dots \notag \\
	\mathrm{output} & \dots, x_t(0), \dots, x_t(M), \Delta^{(1)} x_t(0), \dots, \Delta^{(1)} x_t(M), \dots,
	\Delta^{(n)} x_t(0), \dots, \Delta^{(n)} x_t(M), \dots \notag
 \end{align}
Input and output data are in float format.
The dynamic feature vector $\Delta^{(n)}\bx_t$ is
obtained from the static feature vector as follows.
 \begin{displaymath}
	\Delta^{(n)}\bx_t 
	= \sum_{\tau=-L^{(n)}}^{L^{(n)}} w^{(n)}(\tau)\bx_{t+\tau}
 \end{displaymath}
where $n$ is the order of dynamic feature vector, for
example, when we evaluate $\Delta^2$ parameter, n=2.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{m}{M}{order of vector}{25}
	\argm{l}{L}{length of vector }{$M+1$}
	\argm{d}{(fn~|~d_0~[d_1~\dots])}{$fn$ is 
                the file name of the parameters $w^{(n)}(\tau)$
               	used when evaluating the dynamic feature vector.
                It is assume that the number of coefficients
                to the left and to the right have the same length,
                if this is not true than zeros are added to the
                short side.
                For example, if the coefficients are
	 \begin{displaymath}
		w(-1), w(0), w(1), w(2), w(3)
	 \end{displaymath}
		then zeros are added to the left as follows.
	 \begin{displaymath}
		0, 0, w(-1), w(0), w(1), w(2), w(3)
	 \end{displaymath}
		Instead of entering the filename $fn$,
                the coefficients(which compose the file $fn$)
                can be directly input in the command line.
                When the order of the dynamic feature vector is higher
                then one, then the sets of coefficients can be input
                one after the other as shown on the last example below.
		this option can not be used with the --r option.}{N/A}
	\argm{r}{N_R~W_1~[W_2]}{
		This option is used when $N_R$-th order dynamic parameters
                are used and the weighting coefficients $w^{(n)}(\tau)$
                are evaluated by regression.
                $N_R$ can be made equal to 1 or 2.
		The variables $W_1$ and $W_2$ represent the
                widths of the first and second order regression
                coefficients, respectively.
		The first order regression coefficients for
                $\Delta\bc_t$ at frame $t$ are evaluated as follows.
	 \begin{displaymath}
		\Delta\bc_t
		= \frac{\sum_{\tau=-W_1}^{W_1}\tau \bc_{t+\tau}}%
			{\sum_{\tau=-W_1}^{W_1}\tau^2}
	 \end{displaymath}
		For the second order regression coefficients,
		$a_2 = \sum_{\tau=-W_2}^{W_2} \tau^4$,
		$a_1 = \sum_{\tau=-W_2}^{W_2} \tau^2$,
		$a_0 = \sum_{\tau=-W_2}^{W_2} 1$
                and 
	 \begin{displaymath}
		\Delta^2\bc_t
		= \frac{\sum_{\tau=-W_2}^{W_2}
				(a_0\tau^2 - a_1) \bc_{t+\tau}}
			{2(a_2a_0-a_1^2)}
	 \end{displaymath}
		this option can not be used with the --d option.}{N/A}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, the first and second order dynamic features are calculated from 15-dimensional
coefficient vectors from {\em data.f} using windows whose width are 1, and the resultant 
static and dynamic features are sent to {\em data.delta}:
 \begin{quote}
	\verb!delta -m 15 -r 2 1 1 data.static > data.delta!
 \end{quote}
	or
 \begin{quote}
	\verb!echo "-0.5 0 0.5" | x2x +af > delta! \\
	\verb!echo "0.25 -0.5 0.25" | x2x +af > accel! \\
	\verb!delta -m 15 -d delta -d accel data.pdf > data.par!

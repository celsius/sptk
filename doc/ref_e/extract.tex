{vector quantization}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [extract] [ --l $L$ ] [ --i $I$ ]  {\em indexfile}  [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em extract} extracts selected vectors 
from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the result to standard output. 
{\em indexfile} contains a previously-computed sequence of 
codebook indexes corresponding to the input vectors.  
Only those input vectors whose codebook index (from {\em indexfile}) 
matches the index given by the ``--i'' option 
are sent through to standard output.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{order of vector}{10}
	\argm{i}{I}{codebook index}{0}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, a 10-th order vector file {\em data.v}
in float format is quantized using a previously obtained
codebook {\em data.idx} and writes to the output file {\em data.ex}
the vectors which were quantized to the index 0 codeword.
\begin{quote}
\verb!extract -i 0 data.idx data.v > data.ex!
\end{quote}

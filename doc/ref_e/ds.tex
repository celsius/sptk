\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em ds} down-samples data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
and sends the result to standard output.

Both input and output files are in float format.

The following filter coefficients can be used.

\begin{tabular}{ll} \\[-1ex]
	$S=21$ & \$SPTK/share/SPTK/lpfcoef.2to1 \\
	$S=32$ & \$SPTK/share/SPTK/lpfcoef.3to2 \\
	$S=43$ & \$SPTK/share/SPTK/lpfcoef.4to3 \\
	$S=52,S=54$ & \$SPTK/share/lpfcoef.5to2up \\
	& \$SPTK/share/lpfcoef.5to2dn \\
	$S=74$ & \$SPTK/share/SPTK/lpfcoef.7to4 \\
         &(\$SPTK is the directory where toolkit was installed.)
\end{tabular}

Filter coefficients are in ASCII format.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{s}{S}{conversion type\\
		\begin{tabular}{ll} \\[-1ex]
			$S=21$ & down-sampling by $2:1$ \\
			$S=32$ & down-sampling by $3:2$ \\
			$S=43$ & down-sampling by $4:3$ \\
			$S=52$ & down-sampling by $5:2$ \\
			$S=54$ & down-sampling by $5:4$ \\
			$S=74$ & down-sampling by $7:4$
		\end{tabular}\\\hspace*{\fill}}{21}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
The following example shows that the speech data sampled at 32 kHz is
downsampled to 24 kHz.
\begin{quote}
\verb! ds -s 43 data.32 > data.24 !
\end{quote}
\end{qsection}

\begin{qsection}{NOTICE}
Filter coefficients were designed by Prof. Takao Kobayashi (Tokyo Institute of Technology).

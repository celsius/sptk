\begin{synopsis}
 \item[pitch\_mark] [ --s $S$ ] [ --t $T$ ] [ --L $Lo$ ] [ --H $Hi$ ] [ --o $O$ ][ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em pitch\_mark} extracts the pitch mark from {\em infile} (or standard input),
sending the result to standard output.
The REAPER \cite{ref:pitch-REAPER} algorithm is adopted for pitch mark extraction.
The output format (pulse sequence, second when a pitch mark appears or sample number when a pitch mark appears) can be specified by --o option.

Both input and output files are in float format.

\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
 \argm{s}{S}{sampling frequency (kHz)}{16.0}
 \argm{t}{T}{voiced/unvoiced threshold \\
    value of $t$ should be $-0.5 < t < 1.6$}{0.9}
 \argm{L}{Lo}{minimum fundamental frequency to search for (Hz)}{60.0}
 \argm{H}{Hi}{maximum fundamental frequency to search for (Hz)}{240.0}
 \argm{o}{O}{output format\\
 \begin{tabular}{ll} \\[-1ex]
  $O=0$ & ~~~pulse sequence: if a current sample is a pitch mark,\\
        & ~~~1 or -1 is outputted considering polarity,\\
        & ~~~otherwise 0 is outputted.\\
  $O=1$ & ~~~second when a pitch mark appears\\
  $O=2$ & ~~~sample number when a pitch mark appears\\
 \end{tabular}\\\hspace*{\fill}}{0}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
 In the example below, speech data in float format
 is read from {\em data.f} and the pitch mark data is extracted
 under the condition that sampling frequency is 16kHz
 and the minimum and maximum fundamental frequency are
 80 and 165 Hz, respectively.
 Then, the output is written to {\em data.pitch\_mark}:
 \begin{quote}
  \verb!pitch_mark -s 16 -L 80 -H 165 data.f > data.pitch_mark!
 \end{quote}
\end{qsection}

\begin{qsection}{NOTICE}
Regarding -t option, when the threshold is raised, the number of pitch marks increases.

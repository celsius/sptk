 \item[pca] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$] [ --i $I$] [ --e $e$]
 [ --v ]  [ --V $fn$ ] [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
 {\em pca} applies principal component analysis
 in the data from {\em infile} (or standard input) using the Jacobi method,
 and sends the result to standard output.
 {\em pca} can also calculate contribution ratio with the eigen values.

 In {\em infile},
 the input training data set consists of $L$-dimension vectors of the form:
 \[
 \Vec{x}(0), \Vec{x}(1), \Vec{x}(2), \Vec{x}(3), \cdots \;\;\;
 \mathrm{where}\;\;\Vec{x}(i) = (x_{i}(1), x_{i}(2), \cdots, x_{i}(L))
 \]

Input and output data are in float format. 
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
 \argm{l}{L}{dimension of vector}{3}
 \argm{n}{N}{number of output principal components}{2}
 \argm{i}{I}{limit of iterations of the Jacobi method}{10000}
 \argm{e}{e}{threshold of convergence of the Jacobi method}{0.000001}
 \argm{v}{}{output eigenvectors and mean vector of the training data}{FALSE}
 \argm{V}{fn}{output eigenvalues and contribution rate (output filename = fn)}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
 In the example below,
 the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues are
 calculated  from {\em data.f}
 which contains three-dimensional training vectors.
 The mean vectors and eigenvectors are sent to
 {\em pca.dat}, and the eigenvalues are sent to {\em eigen.dat}.
\begin{quote}
  \verb!pca data.f -n 2 -l 3 -v -V eigen.dat > pca.dat!
\end{quote} 
Note that in the {\em pca.dat}, the mean vector is written in front of
the eigenvectors.
In the {\em eigen.dat}, 
the eigenvalues and their contribution ratio are bound by
the same principal component and ordered according to the
magnitude of the eigen values.

\item [lbg] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$ ] [ --t $T$ ] [ --s $S$ ] [ --e $E$ ]
        [ --f $F$ ] [ --d $D$ ] [ --r $R$ ] 
\item [\ ~~~~] [ {\em indexfile} ] $<$ {\em infile}
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em lbg} uses the LBG algorithm to train a codebook 
from a sequence of vectors from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the result to standard output.

The input sequence consists of $T$ float vectors $\bx$, 
each of size $L$
\begin{displaymath} 
\bx(0), \bx(1), \dots, \bx(T-1). 
\end{displaymath}
The result is a codebook consisting of $E$ float vectors, 
each of length $L$,
\begin{displaymath}
\bC_E =\{ \bc_E(0), \bc_E(1), \dots, \bc_E(E-1) \}, 
\end{displaymath}
generated by the following algorithm.

\begin{description}
\item[\bf step.0~~~]
When a initial codebook $\bC_S$ is not assigned,
the initial codebook is obtained from the whole collection of
training data as follows,
\begin{displaymath}
\bc_1(0) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{n=0}^{T-1} \bx(n)
\end{displaymath}
and the initial codebook with $S = 1$ is $\bC_1 = \{ \bc_1(0) \}$.

\item[\bf step.1~~~]
From codebook $\bC_{S}$ obtain $\bC_{2S}$.
For this step, normalized random vector of size $L$ and splitting factor
$R$ are used as follows,
\begin{displaymath}
\bc_{2S}(n)= \begin{cases}
\;\;\bc_S(n) + R \cdot \bm{\mathrm{rnd}} & ( 0 \le n \le S-1 ) \\
\;\;\bc_S(n) - R \cdot \bm{\mathrm{rnd}} & ( S \le n \le 2S-1 )
\end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
and we make $D_0 = \infty$ and $k = 0$.

\item[\bf step.2~~~]
The present codebook $\bC_{2S}$ is now applied
to the training vectors.
After that the mean Euclidean distance $D_k$ is evaluated
from every training vector and the corresponding code vector.
If the following condition 
\begin{displaymath}
|\frac{D_{k-1}-D_{k}}{D_{k}}| < D
\end{displaymath}
is valid then go to {\bf step.4}.
If it is not valid then go to {\bf step.3}.

\item[\bf step.3~~~]
Centroids are evaluated from the results obtained in {\bf step.2}.
The codebook $\bC_{2S}$ is updated.
Also, if a cell has no training vector, then the corresponding
code vector is erased from codebook,
and a new code vector is generated from the code vector
which corresponds to the cell with more training vectors 
$\bc_{2S}(j)$, as follows.
\begin{displaymath}
\bc_{2S}(i)=\bc_{2S}(j) + R \cdot \bm{\mathrm{rnd}}
\end{displaymath}
After that, we assigned $k=k+1$ and go back {\bf step.2}.

\item[\bf step.4~~~]
If $2S = E$ then end.
If it is not then we make $S$ = $2S$ and go back {\bf step.1}.

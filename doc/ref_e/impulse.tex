\begin{synopsis}
\item[impulse] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$ ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em impulse} generates the unit impulse sequence of length $L$, 
sending the output to standard output. 
The output is in float format as follows.
\begin{displaymath}
\underbrace{1, 0, 0, \dots, 0}_{L}
\end{displaymath}

If both --l and --n options are given, the last one is used.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{length of unit impulse\\
		    if $L < 0$ then endless sequence is generated.}{256}
	\argm{n}{N}{order of unit impulse}{255}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the example below, an unit impulse sequence is passed through 
a digital filter and the results is presented on the screen.
\begin{quote}
 \verb!impulse | dfs -a 1 0.9 -b 1 2 1 | dmp!
\end{quote}

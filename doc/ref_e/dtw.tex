\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
 {\em dtw} carries out dynamic time warping (DTW) between the test data vectors from
 {\em infile} (or standard input) and the reference data vectors from {\em reffile},
 and sends the result to standard output.  The result is the concatenated sequence of
 the test and the reference data vectors along the Viterbi path.  If --s option is
 specified, the score calculated by dynamic time warping, that is, the distance
 between the test data and the reference data is output and sent to {\em Scorefile}.
 If --v option is specified, the concatenated frame number sequence along the Viterbi
 path is output and sent to {\em OutVitfile}.  On the other hand, if --V option is
 specified, the concatenated vector sequence of the test and reference data vectors
 is output based on the content of {\em InVitfile}, where the correspondence of the
 frame numbers between the test and reference data along the Viterbi path is written.
 The format of {\em InVitfile} is the same as {\em OutVitfile}.  The --V option can
 be used to improve the conversion accuracy of \hyperlink{vc}{vc} command.

 For example, suppose that the sequences of the test and the reference data vectors are
 \begin{align}
  \mathrm{test} :\;\; & \bx(1), \bx(2), \dots, \bx(T_x - 1), \bx(T_x), \notag \\
  \mathrm{reference}  :\;\; & \by(1), \by(2), \dots, \by(T_y - 1), \by(T_y), \notag
 \end{align}
 where $T_x$ and $T_y$ are the length of the sequence of the test and reference data
 vectors, respectively. After performing DTW, the following Viterbi sequences
 \begin{align}
  \mathrm{test} :\;\; & \bx(\phi_x(1)), \bx(\phi_x(2)), \dots, \bx(\phi_x(T - 1)),
  \bx(\phi_{x}(T)), \notag \\
  \mathrm{reference}  :\;\; & \by(\phi_y(1)), \by(\phi_y(2)), \dots,
  \by(\phi_y(T - 1)), \by(\phi_y(T)), \notag
 \end{align}
 can be obtained, where $\phi_x(\cdot)$ and $\phi_x(\cdot)$ are the function which
 maps the Viterbi frame number into the corresponding frame number of test/reference
 data, respectively.  Then, the following sequence
 \begin{align}
  \bx(\phi_x(1)), \by(\phi_y(1)),
  \bx(\phi_x(2)), \by(\phi_y(2)),
  \dots, \bx(\phi_{x}(T)), \by(\phi_y(T)) \notag
 \end{align}
 is sent to the standard output.
 If --v option is specified, the following sequence
 \begin{align}
  \phi_x(1), \phi_y(1),
  \phi_x(2), \phi_y(2),
  \dots, \phi_{x}(T), \phi_y(T) \notag
 \end{align}
 is sent to the {\em OutVitfile}.
 On the other hand, if --V option is specified, according to the following sequence
 written in {\em InVitfile}
 \begin{align}
  \phi_x(1), \phi_y(1),
  \phi_x(2), \phi_y(2),
  \dots, \phi_{x}(T), \phi_y(T), \notag
 \end{align}
 the following concatenated vector sequence
 \begin{align}
  \bx(\phi_x(1)), \by(\phi_y(1)),
  \bx(\phi_x(2)), \by(\phi_y(2)),
  \dots, \bx(\phi_{x}(T)), \by(\phi_y(T)) \notag
 \end{align}
 can be obtained and sent to the standard output.

 Both input and output files are in float format. However,
 {\em InVitfile} and {\em OutVitfile} which contains the Viterbi frame number
 sequence is in int format.

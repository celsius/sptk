\name{reverse}{reverse the order of data in each block}{data operation}

\begin{synopsis}
\item[reverse] [ --l $L$ ] [ --n $N$ ] [ {\em infile} ]
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em reverse} reverses the order of data within $L$-length blocks 
of input data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
and sends the result to standard output. 
The default value for $L$ is the entire file. 
If $L$ is given but the file length is not a multiple of $L$, 
leftover values are discarded as shown in the example below.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{length of block}{EOF}
	\argm{n}{N}{order of block}{EOF-1}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
Let's assume that the following data
is read from {\em data.in} file in float format.
\begin{displaymath}
 \underbrace{0.0, ~1.0, ~2.0}, ~
 \underbrace{3.0, ~4.0, ~5.0}, ~
 \underbrace{6.0, ~7.0, ~8.0}, ~9.0
\end{displaymath}
The command
\begin{quote}
\verb!reverse -l 3 data.in > data.out!
\end{quote}
will write the following output to {\em data.out}.
\begin{displaymath}
 \underbrace{2.0, ~1.0, ~0.0}, ~
 \underbrace{5.0, ~4.0, ~3.0}, ~
 \underbrace{8.0, ~7.0, ~6.0}
\end{displaymath}
\end{qsection}

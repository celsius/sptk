\name{lspcheck}{check stability and rearrange LSP}{speech parameter transformation}

\begin{synopsis}
\item [lspcheck] [ --m $M$ ] [ --s $S$ ] [ --k ] [ --i $I$ ] [ --o $O$ ]
		[ --r ] [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
The {\em lspcheck} command checks the stability of LSP coefficients,
and if the filter is not stable,
then the order of coefficients order is changed so that
it becomes a stable filter.
\par
The input data is read in float format.
If the --r option is assigned, then the output data is also
written in float format.
If the --r option is not assigned, then the output brings
the number of the unstable frames in ASCII format.
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{m}{M}{order of LPC}{25}
	\argm{s}{S}{sampling frequency(kHz)}{10}
	\argm{k}{}{input \& output gain}{TRUE}
	\argm{i}{I}{input format}{0}
	\argm{o}{O}{output format \\
		\begin{tabular}{ll} \\[-1zh]
			$0$ & normalized frequency $(0 \ldots \pi)$ \\
			$1$ & normalized frequency $(0 \ldots 0.5)$ \\
			$2$ & frequency (kHz) \\
			$3$ & frequency (Hz)  \\
		\end{tabular}\\\hspace*{\fill}}{0}
	\argm{r}{}{rearrange LSP}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In the following example, 10 order LSP coefficients are
read from {\em data.lsp} in float format,
stability is checked, the unstable coefficients are rearranged
so that they become stable, and the rearranged LSP coefficients
are written to {\em data.lspr}:
\begin{quote}
\verb!lspcheck -r < data.lsp > data.lspr!
\end{quote}

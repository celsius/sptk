\name{ifft}{inverse FFT for complex sequence}{signal processing}

\begin{synopsis}
\item[ifft] [ --l $L$ ]  [ --\{ R $|$ I \} ] [ {\em infile} ] 
\end{synopsis}

\begin{qsection}{DESCRIPTION}
{\em ifft} calculates the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) 
of complex-valued data from {\em infile} (or standard input), 
sending the results to standard output.
The input and output data is in float format, arranged as follows.
\begin{center}
 \leavevmode
 \includegraphics{fig/ifft.eps} 
\end{center}
\end{qsection}

\begin{options}
	\argm{l}{L}{FFT size power of 2}{256}
	\argm{R}{}{output only real part}{FALSE}
	\argm{I}{}{output only imaginary part}{FALSE}
\end{options}

\begin{qsection}{EXAMPLE}
In this example, the inverse DFT is evaluated from a data file
{\em data.f} in float format
(real part: 256 points, imaginary part: 256 points),
and the output is written to {\em data.ifft}:
\begin{quote}
  \verb!ifft data.f -l 256 > data.ifft!
\end{quote}
\end{qsection}

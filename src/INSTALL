                          Environment
****************************************************************

We expect that all programs can be compiled and can work on most
of UNIX-type operation systems.  For Windows operation system,
a makefile for Microsoft Visual C++ is also included.

Note that some commands need C-shell (/bin/csh) since they are
implemented by C-shell scripts.

                          Installation
****************************************************************

0) Enter 'src' directory.

1) Type

       % ./configure --help

  and read the help messages.

2) To build and install all tools, type:

       % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/SPTK
       % make
       % make install

The X-window library is not required for compilation of all tools
except a command 'xgr' since only 'xgr' uses the X-window library.

For Microsoft Visual C++, please use src/Makefile.mak.  Note that
some of commands of SPTK which use GUI and/or audio I/O are not 
supported on the Windows operating system.
